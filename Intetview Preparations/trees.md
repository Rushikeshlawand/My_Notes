## Tree Data Structure

### Definition

A tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes, with a single node as the root. Each node can have zero or more child nodes, and a unique path exists from the root to each node.

### Key Terminology

1. **Node**: The basic unit of a tree containing a value or data.
2. **Root**: The top node of a tree, where tree traversal begins.
3. **Edge**: The link between two nodes.
4. **Leaf**: A node with no children.
5. **Parent**: A node that has one or more child nodes.
6. **Child**: A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root.
7. **Subtree**: A tree consisting of a node and its descendants.
8. **Height**: The length of the longest path from the root to a leaf.
9. **Depth**: The length of the path from the root to a specific node.
