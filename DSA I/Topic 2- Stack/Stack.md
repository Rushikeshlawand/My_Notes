<h1>Stack</h1>
A stack in Java is a basic data structure that adheres to the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) concept. It may be pictured as a stack of things, with the most recent item added being the initial one to be taken away. By allowing actions like push (including an element to the top) and pop (by eliminating and restoring the top element), stacks offer an effective approach to organizing and altering data.

<h2>Methods in Stack Class</h2>

1. push(element): Adds a new element to the stack's top.

2. pop(): Removes and returns the topmost element in the stack.

3. peek(): Returns the topmost stack element without deleting it.

4. empty(): Returns a boolean result that determines if the stack is empty.

5. size(): Gives the stack's element count.

<h2>Applications of Stack in Java</h2>

Stacks check for balanced parentheses, match XML and HTML tags, and validate code syntax.<br>
A stack allows the evaluation of expressions, especially infix, postfix, and prefix expressions. A stack can convert infix expressions to postfix or prefix forms.<br>
Stacks are frequently used by backtracking algorithms, including depth-first search (DFS), to retain track of visited nodes and return to earlier stages during exploration.
