Introduction to operators: 

Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values in a programming language. 
They are essential building blocks for creating expressions, which are combinations of variables, values, and 
operators that produce a result. 


Arithmetic Operators:
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, 
and modulus (remainder). The basic arithmetic operators in Java are:

    Addition (+)
    Subtraction (-)
    Multiplication (*)
    Division (/)
    Modulus (%)
Ex:
int result = 10 + 5;  // Addition
int difference = 10 - 5;  // Subtraction
int product = 10 * 5;  // Multiplication
int quotient = 10 / 5;  // Division
int remainder = 10 % 3;  // Modulus


Relational Operators:
Relational operators are used to compare values and determine the relationship between them. 
These operators return a boolean value (true or false). The relational operators in Java are:

    Equal to (==)
    Not equal to (!=)
    Greater than (>)
    Less than (<)
    Greater than or equal to (>=)
    Less than or equal to (<=)
Ex::
boolean isEqual = (10 == 5);  // Equal to
boolean isNotEqual = (10 != 5);  // Not equal to
boolean isGreater = (10 > 5);  // Greater than
boolean isLess = (10 < 5);  // Less than
boolean isGreaterOrEqual = (10 >= 5);  // Greater than or equal to
boolean isLessOrEqual = (10 <= 5);  // Less than or equal to


Logical Operators:
Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on boolean values. They are typically used to combine multiple conditions or negate a condition. The logical operators in Java are:

    Logical AND (&& or &)
    Logical OR (|| or |)
    Logical NOT (!)
Ex:
boolean condition1 = true;
boolean condition2 = false;
boolean resultAnd = (condition1 && condition2);  // Logical AND
boolean resultOr = (condition1 || condition2);  // Logical OR
boolean resultNot = !condition1;  // Logical NOT


Assignment Operators:
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They can also perform arithmetic or logical operations along with assignment. The basic assignment operator in Java is:

    Assignment (=)

Other assignment operators include compound assignment operators like +=, -=, *=, /=, and %=.
Ex:
int x = 10;  // Assignment
x += 5;  // Compound assignment (x = x + 5)
