1. What is React?

Answer: React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where data changes dynamically without requiring a page reload. It was developed by Facebook and is component-based, allowing developers to build reusable UI components.

Example: In a social media application like Facebook, React might be used to display and update a list of posts without refreshing the page.
2. What is JSX?

Answer: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript, commonly used with React to describe the UI structure. It allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript, making the UI components easier to understand and manage.

Example:

jsx

const element = <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;

This JSX code is transformed into regular JavaScript, such as:

js

const element = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, World!');

3. What are components in React?

Answer: Components are the building blocks of any React application. They can be class-based or function-based and are used to encapsulate reusable code that represents a part of the UI.

Example:

jsx

function Greeting() {
    return <h1>Hello, User!</h1>;
}

Here, Greeting is a functional component that returns a piece of UI.
4. What is the difference between functional and class components?

Answer:

    Functional components are stateless and written as JavaScript functions. They can use React hooks (like useState, useEffect) to manage state and lifecycle.
    Class components are stateful and written using ES6 classes. They have access to lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, shouldComponentUpdate.

Example:

    Functional Component:

    jsx

function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Welcome!</h1>;
}

Class Component:

jsx

    class Welcome extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return <h1>Welcome!</h1>;
      }
    }

5. What are React hooks?

Answer: Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React features (such as state and lifecycle) in functional components. Common hooks include:

    useState: for state management.
    useEffect: for side effects like data fetching.

Example:

jsx

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    return (
        <div>
            <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
        </div>
    );
}

6. What is state in React?

Answer: The state is an object that holds data that influences the output of a component. It can be updated and managed within the component, triggering a re-render whenever changed.

Example:

jsx

class Counter extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { count: 0 };
    }

    increment = () => {
        this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
    };

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <p>{this.state.count}</p>
                <button onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button>
            </div>
        );
    }
}

7. What is the difference between state and props?

Answer:

    State: State is managed within a component, can change over time, and is mutable.
    Props: Props (short for properties) are passed from a parent component to a child component. They are immutable and read-only.

Example:

    Props in a child component:

    jsx

function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

Used in the parent:

jsx

    <Greeting name="Alice" />

8. What is the Virtual DOM in React?

Answer: The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React uses the Virtual DOM to optimize UI updates. When a component’s state or props change, React compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous version (this is called reconciliation), and only updates the parts of the actual DOM that need to be changed.

Example: If only one list item in a large list changes, React will update only that item in the DOM, improving performance.
9. What is useEffect in React?

Answer: The useEffect hook is used to perform side effects in functional components. This includes tasks like fetching data, updating the DOM, or setting up subscriptions. It runs after every render by default but can be optimized by specifying dependencies.

Example:

jsx

useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
}, [count]);  // Only re-run the effect if 'count' changes

10. What is Redux and how does it work with React?

Answer: Redux is a predictable state management library that centralizes the state of your entire application. React can use Redux to manage complex state across multiple components using a single store. Redux follows three principles:

    Single source of truth.
    State is read-only.
    Changes are made using pure functions called reducers.

Example: In a shopping cart application, Redux can manage the cart state globally so any component in the app can access or modify it.

Basic Redux setup:

js

// Action
const addItem = (item) => ({ type: 'ADD_ITEM', payload: item });

// Reducer
const cartReducer = (state = [], action) => {
    switch(action.type) {
        case 'ADD_ITEM':
            return [...state, action.payload];
        default:
            return state;
    }
};

// Store
const store = createStore(cartReducer);

11. How does React handle forms?

Answer: React handles forms using controlled components where form data is managed in the component's state. Input elements like <input>, <textarea>, and <select> maintain their value in the state and update based on user input.

Example:

jsx

function MyForm() {
    const [name, setName] = useState('');
    const handleChange = (e) => setName(e.target.value);

    return (
        <form>
            <input type="text" value={name} onChange={handleChange} />
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
    );
}

12. What are higher-order components (HOCs)?

Answer: A Higher-Order Component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. It’s used to reuse component logic across multiple components.

Example:

jsx

function withAuth(Component) {
    return function AuthComponent(props) {
        const isAuthenticated = true; // Simplified for example
        return isAuthenticated ? <Component {...props} /> : <Redirect to="/login" />;
    };
}

13. What are pure components in React?

Answer: A pure component in React is a component that implements the shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle method with a shallow comparison of props and state. It helps in improving performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

Example:

jsx

class PureGreeting extends React.PureComponent {
    render() {
        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
    }
}

14. What is the difference between useCallback and useMemo?

Answer:

    useCallback: It memoizes a callback function to prevent it from being recreated on every render, useful for optimizing child components that depend on functions.
    useMemo: It memoizes the result of a computation and only recomputes it when dependencies change, preventing unnecessary calculations.

Example:

jsx

const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
    doSomething(a, b);
}, [a, b]);

const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);

Here are additional important React interview questions, covering advanced topics, optimization, and ecosystem tools:
15. What is the difference between useEffect and useLayoutEffect?

Answer:

    useEffect: Runs asynchronously after rendering, making it suitable for tasks like data fetching, timers, or updating the DOM after the render is painted.
    useLayoutEffect: Runs synchronously after DOM mutations but before the browser repaints the screen. It's useful for measuring or modifying the layout (e.g., animations, measuring DOM elements).

Example:

jsx

useEffect(() => {
    console.log('useEffect: Runs after paint');
});

useLayoutEffect(() => {
    console.log('useLayoutEffect: Runs before paint');
});

16. What is the Context API?

Answer: The Context API allows you to pass data through the component tree without manually passing props at every level. It’s used for global state management in React applications to avoid "prop drilling."

Example:

jsx

const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

function App() {
    return (
        <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
            <Toolbar />
        </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
}

function Toolbar() {
    return <ThemedButton />;
}

function ThemedButton() {
    const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
    return <button>{theme}</button>;
}

17. What are React Portals?

Answer: React Portals allow you to render a component outside of its parent DOM hierarchy. It is useful for rendering elements like modals, tooltips, or pop-ups where z-index or overflow might interfere with the layout.

Example:

jsx

const modalRoot = document.getElementById('modal-root');

function Modal({ children }) {
    return ReactDOM.createPortal(children, modalRoot);
}

18. What is Prop Drilling and how can it be avoided?

Answer: Prop drilling refers to passing data through multiple levels of components even if only the child component needs it. This makes the code harder to maintain and debug. It can be avoided using the Context API or state management libraries like Redux.

Example: Instead of passing props down multiple levels:

jsx

<Parent>
  <Child>
    <Grandchild prop={value} />
  </Child>
</Parent>

Use Context to provide value directly to Grandchild without drilling.
19. What is the difference between React.memo and React.PureComponent?

Answer:

    React.memo: It is used to optimize functional components. It prevents unnecessary re-renders by memoizing the component and re-rendering only if the props change.
    React.PureComponent: It’s used for class components. It performs a shallow comparison of props and state to avoid re-rendering unless there are changes.

Example:

    React.memo for functional components:

    jsx

    const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
        return <div>{props.value}</div>;
    });

20. How does the React rendering process work?

Answer: React uses a two-phase process:

    Reconciliation: React builds a Virtual DOM to compare the old and new states. Only the differences are marked for update.
    Commit Phase: After reconciliation, React updates the real DOM in a minimal and efficient way using a process called diffing.

Example: If a component’s state changes, React compares the current state and props with the previous ones, calculates the minimal set of changes, and applies them to the real DOM.
21. What are React fragments?

Answer: Fragments allow you to group multiple elements without adding an extra DOM node (like a div). This helps keep the DOM structure clean.

Example:

jsx

return (
    <React.Fragment>
        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <p>World!</p>
    </React.Fragment>
);

You can also use the shorthand:

jsx

return (
    <>
        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <p>World!</p>
    </>
);

22. What is lazy loading in React?

Answer: Lazy loading is a technique to defer loading components until they are required, improving the initial loading performance of an app. React provides React.lazy() to achieve this in combination with Suspense.

Example:

jsx

const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./MyComponent'));

function App() {
    return (
        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
            <LazyComponent />
        </Suspense>
    );
}

23. What is the useReducer hook and when should you use it?

Answer: useReducer is an alternative to useState for managing complex state logic or multiple states that depend on each other. It allows state updates via a reducer function (similar to Redux).

Example:

jsx

const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'increment':
            return { count: state.count + 1 };
        case 'decrement':
            return { count: state.count - 1 };
        default:
            return state;
    }
}

function Counter() {
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
    return (
        <div>
            <p>{state.count}</p>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
            <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
        </div>
    );
}

24. What are error boundaries in React?

Answer: Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire application.

Example:

jsx

class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { hasError: false };
    }

    static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
        return { hasError: true };
    }

    componentDidCatch(error, info) {
        console.log(error, info);
    }

    render() {
        if (this.state.hasError) {
            return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
        }
        return this.props.children;
    }
}

25. What is server-side rendering (SSR) in React, and how does it differ from client-side rendering (CSR)?

Answer:

    Server-Side Rendering (SSR): In SSR, the React components are rendered on the server and the complete HTML is sent to the client. This improves initial load time and SEO but increases server load.
    Client-Side Rendering (CSR): In CSR, the components are rendered entirely in the browser after the initial HTML is loaded. This reduces server load but can result in slower initial load times.

Example:

    SSR in Next.js:

    js

export async function getServerSideProps() {
    const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await res.json();
    return { props: { data } };
}

CSR in traditional React:

js

    useEffect(() => {
        fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
            .then(res => res.json())
            .then(setData);
    }, []);

26. What is the significance of keys in React?

Answer: Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed in lists. They are essential for efficiently updating the UI and maintaining component state across renders.

Example:

jsx

const items = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];
return (
    <ul>
        {items.map((item, index) => (
            <li key={index}>{item}</li>
        ))}
    </ul>
);

27. What is reconciliation in React?

Answer: Reconciliation is the process React uses to update the DOM. When the state or props of a component change, React compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous version. It then updates only the changed elements (this process is also called diffing).

Example: When a list item is updated, React compares the new and old lists using keys and only updates the modified list item, rather than re-rendering the entire list.
28. How does React handle events?

Answer: React handles events using synthetic events, which are cross-browser wrappers around the browser’s native events. This ensures that events behave consistently across different browsers.

Example:

jsx

function handleClick(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('Link clicked');
}

return <a href="#" onClick={handleClick}>Click me</a>;
